# **About Me**

Hi I am **{{ site.author.name }}** :wave:,<br>
I am an AI engineer focused on building real-world AI systems and taking them all the way to production, from design and development to deployment and maintenance.

I build end-to-end AI applications using LLMs, AI agents, and RAG pipelines—turning ideas and prototypes into scalable, production-ready systems.

My work sits at the intersection of AI, software engineering, and product: APIs, orchestration workflows, and inference systems that are reliable, performant, and maintainable.
